### Fix

### Modification

- Merukari sold counter doesnâ€™t give me any MSC when I input a new URL

- Get MSC by inputting S.P. to the max input on the webpage - Version - 1.2.0

### Question

- Are we receiving a response with "https://api.mercari.jp/v2/entities:search"?

- What's "Issue parsing JSON response" in the console? when I input old URL format in the input.csv

### Future work

- Convert if sentences into shorthand

- Organize functions into separated files

- Implement in a way that it's easier to see the correspondence between headers and values

- Implement in a way that it's easier to see the correspondence between headers and values
